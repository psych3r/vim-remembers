INTRODUCTION                                                 *remembers-intro*

vim-remembers is a simple plugin that automatically saves unnamed buffers on
|VimLeavePre|, creates a session file on |VimLeave| and reloads the same session 
on |VimEnter|.                  
                                -- unnamed buffers created by |enew|, |tabnew| --

It was inspired by the behavior of some text editors like Notepad++ where
you can create and edit unnamed buffers, close the editor and open it again
with all your buffers intact as if you saved them. However, vim-remembers 
saves the buffers and creates a session file to load them again.

FEATURES                                                  *remembers-features*

Unnamed buffers are written in `g:remembers_tmp_dir`.
file name format: >
    g:remembers_tmp_prefix + timestamp + _n + g:remembers_tmp_suffix 
where `n` is a number starting from `1` and increments for every unnamed buffer
in the |:buffers| list.  >
    let g:remembers_tmp_prefix = "tmp_" 
    let g:remembers_tmp_suffix = ".txt" 
file name:  tmp_20201114114659_1.txt 

On |VimLeavePre|, if vim was called with no file arguments (|argc|) or
`g:remembers_always_create` is set to `1`, save a session file called 
`g:remembers_session_fname` in `g:remembers_session_dir`.

On |VimEnter|, if vim was called with no file arguments (|argc|) or
`g:remembers_always_reload` is set to `1`,  load the session called 
`g:remembers_session_fname` in `g:remembers_session_dir`.

Combinations of `g:remembers_always_create` and `g:remembers_always_reload` values 
control how the plugin behaves. They both default to `0`.

CONFIGURATION                                        *remembers-configuration*

This is a list of all the configuration variables (shown with their default
values):

* only create a session file if vim is called with no file arguments.
  when set to `1` it always creates a session. >
    let g:remembers_always_create   = 0
<
* only reload a session if vim is called with no file arguments.
  when set to `1` it always reloads. >
    let g:remembers_always_reload   = 0
<
* prefix used to write unnamed files e.g. tmp_%timestamp%_1 >
    let g:remembers_tmp_prefix      = 'tmp_'
<
* suffix used to write unnamed files. used to set file extensions e.g. tmp_%timestamp%_1{suffix} >
    let g:remembers_tmp_suffix      = ''
<
* unnamed buffers are saved here >
    let g:remembers_tmp_dir         = '~/.vim/.tmp_files'

* session files are saved here >
    let g:remembers_session_dir     = '~/.vim/.tmp_files'
<
* session file name -- notice it's hidden by default >
    let g:remembers_session_fname   = '.remembers_session.vim'
